# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.
#### Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed in data analysis and in data science.The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results, to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
#### Results
There was no sufficient evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.
## Project Steps:
#### Data Wrangling:
* remove duplicates or records with missing or mismatched values
* handle the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align
#### Statistical Analysis Scope
* Bootstrapping sampling distributions
* Perform Hypothesis Testing
* P-value and Z-score calculation
* Logistic regression
#### Tools
* Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy
* Jupyter Notebook
